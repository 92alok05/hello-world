Hello World,
  After completing my education in computer science, I am currently working in a MNC where I get to code everyday. I came across a talk from 2009 Google I/O called "Myth of a Genius Programmer", which inspired me to take sometime out of my schedule and contribute something to the open source world, while learning new technologies along the way.
I actually had another GitHub account with some repositories created in it, which was used for submissions to certain competitions but i lost access to that account as I did not have the necessary security key for the second factor authentication. Apparently, the only thing  you can do if you lose your second factor is to reset your account. Hence this new account. If anyone is interested in looking at those repositories then those are imported here, or you can search for the username - 92alok (which is now inactive)
Anyways, hoping to start a new path with proper contributions with this new account.
